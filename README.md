## CSV to GPX
CSV to GPX code converts the CSV file to GPX file. Most of the commercial routing and map matching apps/websites get GPX format as the
input, so this code can be used to get the CSV file of the trajectories of entities with unique ids (for example vehicles trajectory) and
make a GPX file for each entity (each vehicle) trajectory.
